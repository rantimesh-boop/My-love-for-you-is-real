## Packages
framer-motion | Complex animations for the "No" button evasion and page transitions
canvas-confetti | For the celebration effect when "Yes" is clicked
@types/canvas-confetti | Types for confetti
use-sound | For playing the romantic music and sound effects
lucide-react | Icons for UI elements

## Notes
The app relies on URL parameters (?name=) for personalization.
It uses local state mostly, with an optional backend call to track "Yes" responses if the API is available.
Fonts are critical for the aesthetic: 'Architects Daughter' for headers, 'DM Sans' for body.
